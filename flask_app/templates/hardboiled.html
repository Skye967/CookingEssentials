                <h2>Boiled eggs</h2>
                
                <p>Ask any egg aficionado how to boil eggs, and they might start by telling you something you weren’t expecting to hear: Start with some eggs, lol.</p>

                <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</p>
                <p> The first step is boiling a large pot of water on your stovetop. (You only need water, by the way. Some recipes call for salting the water or adding baking soda, but adding either is completely optional and, honestly, unnecessary.)</p>

                <p>Make sure you add enough water to cover all your eggs completely. Eggs that aren’t completely submerged will be unevenly cooked.</p>

                <p>A note on hot water versus cold water: You might have heard that you should start the eggs in room temperature or cold water and then bring them to a boil. This is a myth. According to our tests, starting with hot water yields eggs that are easier to peel—so always start by boiling your water.</p>

                <p>2. Gently lower the eggs into the water</p>
                <p>Once the water has come to a rolling boil, use a large spoon to lower the eggs into the boiling water. (If you drop the eggs in haphazardly, they can hit the bottom of the pot and crack, leaving you with egg whites floating in the water.)</p>

                <p>3. Lower the heat slightly and boil for 8 to 14 minutes</p>
                <p>If the water is still at a full boil, lower the high heat to a simmer so that the eggs aren’t jumping around in the pan. Then set a timer and let the eggs cook to your desired doneness. Boiled eggs can be ready to eat in as little as 4 minutes, though at that point they will be soft-boiled (the kind you spoon right out of the shell). After 8 minutes they will be hard-boiled, but those who like drier hard-boiled eggs can keep going all the way to 14 minutes. Refer to the table of cooking times below and experiment to find your ideal level of doneness.</p>

                <p>How Long to Boil an Egg</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>4 minutes: Ramen-style, jammy soft-boiled eggs</li>
                    <li>5 minutes: firm white eggs with runny yolk</li>
                    <li>6 minutes: firm white eggs with gooey yolk</li>
                    <li>8 minutes: firm white eggs with fully set yolk, but still sort of gooey and golden</li>
                    <li>10 minutes: firm white eggs with a firmer pale yolk, with just a bit softness in the middle</li>
                    <li>12 minutes: firm white eggs with an almost completely hard-boiled yolk</li>
                    <li>14 minutes: firm white eggs with a completely hard-boiled—crumbly and dry—pale yolk</li>
                </ol>
                <p>4. Transfer the eggs to an ice-water bath</p>
                <p>When the timer goes off, use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs from the boiling water to a large bowl full of ice water. Not only will the ice bath stop the egg from overcooking (ensuring it will be exactly as you want it), it also makes the eggs easier to peel.</p>

                <p>5. Peel the eggs</p>
                <p>When your eggs are cool enough to handle, peel them under cool running water. The water will get under the egg shell, which will help you lift the shell away cleanly. (It also ensures that any tiny flecks of shell left on the eggs are washed away.)</p>

                <p>Now that your eggs are ready, eat them! You can enjoy them on their own, of course, or you can use them in sandwiches, salads, pasta, casseroles, and grain bowls.
