                    <h2>Chicken</h2>
                    <p>Chicken is a versatile and adaptable protein that is served in countless ways across myriad cuisines. Despite being one of the most ubiquitous cuts of meat in the United States, chicken breast can also be one of the hardest to cook, often teetering a fine line between undercooked and dry. </p>

                    <h2>Steak</h2>
                    <p>Preparing steak at home can be daunting because even slightly under- or overcooking has a huge impact on flavor and texture. The key to cooking good steak is to learn your preferred degree of doneness, and to identify the visual and textural cues that will get you there every time.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Pork</h2>
                    <p>Pork has a great quality in that it is a fatty protein that does well in keeping itself moist and flavorful.â€œThe cell membranes of the muscle tissue contain fatty acids that disintegrate during cooking to yield a bouquet of flavourful compounds like aldehydes, furans, and ketones.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Fish</h2>
                    <p>Cooking fish and seafood is one of the greatest adventures in the kitchen. Done right, a sweet and flaky fillet of fish is easy and delicious. </p>
