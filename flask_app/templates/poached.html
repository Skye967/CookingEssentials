                <p>Tips for Perfect Poached Eggs</p>
                <p>Cooking poached eggs with the perfect shape, texture, and doneness can be tricky. Here are a few tips for getting them perfect every time.</p>

                <p>Choose fresh eggs. The freshest eggs have a unique texture that makes them ideal for poaching. Specifically, egg whites become more watery as the eggs get older. This can cause your eggs to spread out in the poaching water, making the whites wispy. For best results, use very fresh eggs that have been purchased within the last few days.</p>

                <p>Use the right temperature. Unlike a soft-boiled egg, which is protected by its shell, a poached egg is fully exposed, and therefore very delicate. Cooking too high can cause your poached eggs to break, while cooking too low can cause them to spread apart. Instead, aim for a gentle simmer (about 185ÂºF).
                Remember the vinegar. The pH balance of your simmering water can also affect whether your eggs turn out wispy. Adding a splash of vinegar to your water makes it more acidic, which effectively lowers the temperature needed for the egg whites to set, helping your poached eggs keep a tight shape.</p>

                <p>PREP TIME 10 min</p>
                <p>COOK TIME 20 min</p>
                <p>TOTAL TIME 30 min</p>
                <p>Ingredients</p>
                <p>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</p>
                <p>4 eggs</p>

                <p>1. Fill a medium-size saucepot with cold water and bring to a gentle boil.</p>
                <p>2. Season boiling water with salt and add white wine vinegar. Stir the water with a whisk until swirling. Crack eggs into individual small bowls. Lower each bowl and gently drop eggs into water. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to poach eggs in separate batches. 
                <p>3. Turn heat down to gentle simmer. Cook eggs for 2 minutes, then check them. If they are firm to touch, remove from water with slotted spoon; if they wobble, return to water for another 10 seconds.</p>
                <p>4. Remove eggs to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess moisture. Turn eggs presentation side up, season with salt and pepper.</p>
