            <p>Ingredients</p>
            <p>2 cups  mix</p>
            <p>1 cup milk</p>
            <p>2 eggs</p> 

            <p>1. Grease or spray griddle or skillet. Heat over medium-high heat or electric griddle to 375°F. (Surface is ready when a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and disappear.)</p>

            <p>2. Stir all ingredients until blended. Pour by slightly less than 1/4 cupfuls onto hot griddle.</p>

            <p>3. Cook until edges are dry. Turn; cook until golden.</p>

            <p>Expert Tips</p>

            <p>Cook these cakes on a true cast-iron griddle or in a large cast-iron skillet. Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the hot pan (it’s ready when a drop of water sizzles on the surface), then don’t turn them until they puff up and bubbles form on top. Flip them just once, cooking until just golden brown.</p>

            <p>Don't flip 'em more than once! Repeated cooking on both sides toughens rather than browns the pancakes.</p>
            
            <p>Keep pancakes warm until ready to serve by placing them uncovered in a single layer on a paper towel-lined cookie sheet in a 200°F oven.</p>

            <p>Serve pancakes topped with sliced banana, raspberries, blueberries, or grated chocolate for a delicious way to start your day.</p>

            <p>Freeze leftover pancakes stacked between sheets of waxed paper, then wrapped in foil or a plastic freezer bag. To reheat, unwrap pancakes and remove waxed paper. Place 1 pancake at a time on microwaveable safe plate and microwave on High for 30 to 60 seconds or until heated through. Top with peanut butter mixed with maple syrup to make them on-the-go friendly.</p>
